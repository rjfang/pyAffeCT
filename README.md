# Abstract
we introduce a Python toolkit designed to fulfill two key roles: establishing a standardized benchmark for affective computing datasets and offering an all-encompassing toolkit for machine learning in physiological signal based affective computing. This toolkit encompasses vital components essential to the machine learning process, encompassing tasks like dataset integration and interpretation, signal preprocessing, feature derivation, post-processing, classification models, and evaluation metrics. Our proposed toolkit is designed for working with seven publicly available datasets, embracing five different modalities and incorporating twenty diverse machine learning models spanning from conventional options like the support vector machine (SVM) to cutting-edge deep learning models.

# Examples
Under **examples/** folder you can find multiple examples using traditional machine learning or deep learning on different dataset. In addition, *Demo.ipynb* explores the essential module which is a good start point.
